        <h1>The Fight Against Chimp Trafficking</h1>

        <h2>Chimp Trafficking</h2>
        <p>
            West and Central Africa are home to one of humanity's closest cousins. Chimpanzees. However, they don't always stay there; animal
            traffickers smuggle chimps out of their natural habitats and to be sold around the world to anyone inclined to buy one illegally.
            Trafficking has negative consequences for both the ecosystem the chimp is removed from and the chimp itself, all for financial gain
            and personal amusement. This is why there are organisations that seek to reinstate the chimps and put an end to the exotic animal
            trading networks. These anti-trafficking organisations are helped in recent years by developments in computer science.
        </p>

        <h2>Facial Recognition of Chimps</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46945302">The information of this paragraph was found in this BBC article.</a>
            The old way to trace a trafficked chimp was to search around social media looking for suspicious posts that might tip off
            anti-traffickers as to the whereabouts of the chimp or leads to buyers who may be able to give information on poachers such that they
            can be brought to justice and disrupt future trafficking.   
        </p>
        <p>
            The new, nore effiecient, way is to use facial recognition. First an AI must be trained to identify chimps, which can be difficult
            given there similarity with humans, and then for each individual trained with up to 30 photos, preferably from a range of angles. Once
            trained the AI can be let loose on social media or other photo sharing platforms to search for chimps and match them to an indivdual
            so that their trafficking journey can be traced.

        <h2>Genetic Mapping of Chimps</h2>

            This more recent technique to fight chimp traders is to create a map of the genomes of chimps by area such that given the DNA of a news
            chimp, perhaps one that is recovered from trafficking or a former chimp who was found in a bushmeat market. Roughly 800 chimps DNA was
            used to create the map and the DNA of the trafficked chimp can be ran through to produce the area that it is from. Perhaps this is used
            for rehabilitation but in the crime fighting arena this is used to find the places that poachers operate and shut them down.
